# Charter Calculator/Map

A map application that provides a charter calculator and direction services all in one place. The map application was developed as part of a bus company's requirement for a charter calculator that featured all the tools in one place. As a GIS/Full stack developer I created the app to make the life of Analysts and Dispatcher's life a little easy.
